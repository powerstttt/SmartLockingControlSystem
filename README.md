Date: 16 June 2020

This project was created for EEM414 Design Project.

Smart Locking Control System is a system that provide control your door lock remotely.

This application is a beta version, which means it will take many updates to use in daily life.

It connects to a server (it can be found named by LoginApp in my Git repository) via internet and Smart Locking Control System itself via Bluetooth.

More detail can be found in Mobile Application Report as you can see in repo MobileApplcationReport.pdf.
